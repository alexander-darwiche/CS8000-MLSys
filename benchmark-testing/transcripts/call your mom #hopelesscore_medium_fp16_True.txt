 I could call up my mom and be like, Hey mom, what's your experience with menopause? And she would just lay it out for me. She would tell me about the hormonal changes and the loss of bone density and stuff like that. And I would be like, wow, that sounds like it's hard. And she would say, yeah, it was an adjustment. She wouldn't be like, oh! I can't talk to you about gross stuff, even though literally you're made of my eggs and your dad's cum, and I squeezed you out of my pussy 34 years ago. It's just, it's biology, man. It's just skin and bone and flesh and tendons and sinews and muscles and mucus, man. What do you think you're made of? Gozo is the same shit. Stop, stop, a stork brought me down. A stork in a little blue bindle. They put me at my parents' doorstep. My dad definitely wasn't in it from the back with a fist full of her hair or anything like that. And he was going, where should I do it? And she was like, do it inside. And then he was like, are you sure? And then, come on, man, we're all adults here. I bet grandpa was just hitting the missionary, no big deal. Oh, so you like imagining your grandpa and your grandma like nose to nose while he's bumping up against your damn cervix. Just looking at each other's eyes saying, I love you and stuff like that, whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears. Every once in a while, he like leans down and kisses her on the neck and she moans lightly in his ear. You like imagining your grandparents getting down with that, you sick fuck? I'm not asking you to like imagine it in vivid detail. That's your subconscious surfacing that for you. I'm simply saying they did it, probably. Maybe they didn't, but they probably did.
